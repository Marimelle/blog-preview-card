## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS variables for color, spacing and font

- Flexbox for layout

### What I learned

1. **Semantic HTML Structure**

    Used `<main> ` for the primary content and `<footer>` for the attribution text

    Wrapped the card in `<article>` for better semantics.

    Implemented proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` for the title, `<p>` for text).

    Added descriptive `alt` text to images for accessibility.

2. **CSS Techniques**

    Flexbox: Centered the card using flexbox and `margin: auto`


    Interactivity: Created hover effects for the blog title (color change and cursor pointer).

3. **Design Implementation**

    Matched the designâ€™s colors, spacing, and borders from the Figma design file.

    Used `border-radius` for rounded corners and `box-shadow` for depth.

4. **Debugging Wins**

    Fixed image overflow by adding `overflow: hidden` to the parent container.

    Resolved spacing issues with `margin` and `padding` adjustments.

5. **Accessibility**

    Ensured all images have meaningful `alt` attributes.
